\title{Generate violin plots for treatment group comparisons}
\description{
  This function generates violin plots for comparing posterior distributions 
  of treatment group effects on cell migration.
}
\usage{
  get_violins(x, from_groups, to_group)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object generated by \code{cellmig}.}
  \item{from_groups}{A vector of group names to compare against the 
  target group.}
  \item{to_group}{A single group name serving as the reference for 
  comparisons.}
}
\details{
  The function extracts posterior samples of treatment group-level means and 
  computes differences between specified groups. It generates a violin plot 
  illustrating these differences and returns both the computed data and the 
  plot object.
}
\value{
  A list with two elements:
  \item{ds}{A data frame containing computed differences, treatment group 
  identifiers, and associated statistics.}
  \item{plot}{A ggplot2 object representing the violin plot of the computed
  treatment differences.}
}
