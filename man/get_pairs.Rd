\title{Compare the cell migration effects of treatment groups (cellvel results)}
\usage{
get_pairs(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object generated by \code{cellvel}}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following data in each row (comparison):
\itemize{
\item treatment group x
\item treatment group y
\item \eqn{\delta_M} = mean delta
\item \eqn{\delta_M}, \eqn{\delta_{L95}}, \eqn{\delta_{H95}} = mean, lower 
bound and upper bound of the difference between the migration effects of 
treatments x and y
\item \eqn{\pi} = probability of differential effects
}
}
\description{
The function \code{get_pairs} compares the overall treatment group effects 
with each other, i.e. computes differences in their posterior distributions.
}
\details{
The main input, \code{x}, of \code{get_pairs} is the output object from
the function \code{cellmig}.

For a pair of treatment groups, \code{get_pairs} compares extracts the 
posterior distributions of their cell migration effects, and then compute 
an absolute difference between the posteriors. The result is another 
posterior distribution (\eqn{\delta}), with L95 and H95 as the lower and 
upper bounds of the 95\% highest density interval of \eqn{\delta}.

\eqn{\pi} is estimated as: \eqn{\pi=2\cdot\max{(\int_{-\infty}^{0} \delta,
\int_{0}^{+\infty} \delta)}-1}.

For treatment groups, i and j, where \eqn{\delta<0} and the 95\% HDIs of
\eqn{\delta} lie mostly or completely below 0 (0 = null effect), we have
strong evidence of lower cell migration effect in treatment i compared to
j. On the other hand, for treatment groups, i and j, where \eqn{\delta} and 
the 95\% HDI of \eqn{\delta} lie mostly or completely above 0, we have strong 
evidence of higher cell migration effect in treatment i compared to j. 
Distributions with the 95\% HDIs more or less centered around 0 indicate 
that there is no evidence for a clear differnce in the cell migration effects
between the treatment groups. Note that unclear evidence is not equivalent 
to no change, because for a treatment group with \eqn{\delta\approx 0} we 
may also have a wide 95\% HDI, including possibilities for positive or 
negative change.
