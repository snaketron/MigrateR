\title{Visualization of compound effect profiles (cellvel results)}
\usage{
get_profiles(x,
             hc_link = "average",
             hc_dist = "euclidean",
             select_ds,
             select_ts)
}
\value{
A patchwork plot with:
\itemize{
\item A = hierarchical dendrogram comparing compound effects curves
\item B = mean effects on cell migration of compound and dose with 95\%
credible intervals
\item C = mean effects on cell migration of compound and dose in each
replicate with 95\% credible intervals
}
}
\description{
The functions takes as a main input (\code{x}) the output of the function
cellvel. The user can select a subset of the compounds (with input
\code{select_ts}, and doses (with input \code{select_ds}). To construct a
hierarchical dendrogram one has to select a distance metric, \code{hc_dist},
(e.g. \code{hc_dist} = "euclidean"); and a linkage function, \code{hc_link},
(e.g. \code{hc_link} = "average").
}
\details{
The function \code{get_profiles} visualizes the compound effect profiles,
i.e. which compounds similar effects of cell migration across the different
doses? These compounds are clustered together in the hierarchical dendrogram.
